([Titanic with a cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEPfM3jSoBw))

Answer a few more questions about the *Titanic* data set. You may want to do a little online research to figure out how to create some of the additional plots.

1.	Use the data dictionary file posted to Canvas to identify each variable in the dataset as categorical or quantitative. If the variable is categorical, further identify it as ordinal, nominal or an identifier variable.

2.	Create a new variable called `Survived_str` that takes on the value `Did Not Survive` when `Survived == 0` and `Survived` when `Survived == 1`.

3.	Calculate the frequency and relative frequency of survival for *Titanic* passengers.

4.	Calculate the frequency and relative frequency of passengers in each ticket class.

5.	Create a bar chart to display the number of passengers who survived and did not survive the *Titanic* sinking.

6.	Create a pie chart to display the percent of passengers who traveled under each ticket class.

7.	Create a frequency table to show the joint distribution of survival and passenger ticket class.

8.	Draw a side-by-side bar chart to show the number of passengers in each ticket class who survived and did not survive.

9.	Summarize your findings about survival on the *Titanic* and how a passengerâ€™s ticket class might have affected his or her survival.
