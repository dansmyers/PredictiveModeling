# Sprint 1 &ndash; Descriptive Statistics and Visualization

## Starts Thursday, 1/19
## Deliverables and quiz are due on Wednesday, 2/8

## Overview and Goals

This is it: the first sprint. We're going to do four things:

1. Get comfortable with the rhythms and practice of Scrumage.
2. Learn (or review) the important elements of R programming
3. Review important background concepts on descriptive statistics, including measures of centrality, measures of spread,
quartiles, box plots, and histograms.
4. Get comfortable using R to conduct a non-trivial data analysis and visualize results.

At the end of the sprint, you'll have three things to complete:

1. The deliverables described in this project.
2. An individual quiz.
3. A short individual reflective write-up.
4. Questions from the online ZyBook.

The content for this sprint is not particularly difficult, although you will need to get familiar with R and R Studio, which may be new for you. As you're working,
focus on getting into the rhythm of Scrumage and developing good working habits with your teams that will carry you through the more content-heavy sprints that are coming up.


## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the project described in `Deliverables`. Remember that you may work freely with the members of your team and you may use any resources that you find helpful to
complete the project.

The quiz and reflective write-up will be done **online** on **Wednesday, February 8**, which will also be the release day for the next sprint's material. The quiz will be 
**individual** (not team) but will be **open everything**: you can use the sprint resources, your notes, and online resources. Remember to abide by the Honor Code 
and ask me if you have questions about what is an acceptable resource!

## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapter 5 of the ZyBook. You do not need to complete the challenge questions or any sections marked as optional.


## What You Need to Learn

1. Different terms for describing data: qualitative, quantitative, continuous, discrete, categorical, ordinal, etc.

2. The **mean** and **median** as measures of centrality of a data set. This will be review for all of you, but make sure that you can correctly calculate means and medians
given a small input data set. Know about the **mode** of a categorical data set.

3. The concept of **percentiles** of a quantitative data set. Be able to calculate the **quartiles** and **interquartile range** of an example data set.

4. The concept of **outliers** in a data set. Using the interquartile range to identify outliers. Understand that outliers may be due to errors, but they may also be natural features of the dataset or unusual, but still correct, data values.

5. The **standard deviation** and **variance** as the most important measures of spread. Be able to calculate both values for a small example data set.

6. Importing datasets into Python. Performing basic manipulations and selecting subsets using the Pandas framework.

7. Creating bar charts and frequency tables and using them to draw conclusions about a data set.

8. **Box plots** as visualizations of a quantitative data set, both interpreting them and creating them in Python.

9. **Histograms** as visualizations of a quantitative data set. Again, know how to interpret them and create them in Python.

I will not make you perform extensive calculations by hand (no one does that in real life), but you should be able to manually calculate means, medians, quartiles, the five 
number summary, and variance for small data sets.


## Resources

### Labs

Complete the two labs in the `Labs` directory. These will be familiar to some of you from previous computer science classes, but it's likely been a while since you had to use the Python data science framework.

The first lab demonstrates how to use Python and Pandas to perform basic data analysis. The second is an intro to the general concepts of predictive modeling using the *Titanic* data set.

### Descriptive Stats

There are many readily available resources with information on basic descriptive statistics and most of this material will be review for you. Here are some videos covering
the basics:

- [Measures of central tendency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSNm7cNMVdM&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=2) ("Central Tendency" is a great name for a progressive metal band)
- [Range and interquartile range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzXsgs_DxGI&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=3)
- [Five number summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifhx1vCKZGU&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=11)
- [Box plots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJlvCxHMB_4&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=12) (you only need the first three minutes)
- [Creating histograms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSEYtAjuZ-Y)
- [Variance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4HAYd0QnRc) (the key idea is the concept of variance as the average squared distance from the mean)


## Recommended Schedule and Tips

- **Week 1**: Complete Chapter 1 of the ZyBook and the first homework problem on statistical calculations. We will complete Lab 1 in class and you should use the document
in the `Examples` directory to review any parts you find challenging.

- **Week 2**: Complete Chapter 2 of the ZyBook. We will complete Labs 2 and 3 in class, after which you will be able to complete the remaining two homework problems.

- **Week 3 before the quiz**: Complete the last problem using Lab 3 as a reference if you didn't finish it during the second week. Finish any remaining ZyBook questions.

- **Don't wait until the last minute**! You won't have time to finish everything if you don't start promptly.

- The lab documents are important resources. Review them and use them as references when completing the homework projects.

- Remember that you're allowed to work with members of your team and use any other web resources you find useful.
