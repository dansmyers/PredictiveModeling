## Overview

This is it, the final piece of our journey through the world of modeling and AI. You're going to complete two things:

1. A short presentation for the Foundations Summit on April 27.
2. One more piece of writing with a critical thinking element. This assignment will take the place of the final exam, since we're not having a written final.

You may work with a partner to complete both of these assignments if you choose.

The Foundations Summit is a chance to show what we've been working on during the semester. You're going to prepare a short presentation, using PowerPoint or a similar program, that you'll give to folks as they walk around the summit and visit your tables.

The topifof your presentation will be the intersection of AI and liberal education. That's a pretty broad topic, so you can pick a theme that resonates with you. Some ideas might include:

- Strategies you've learned for using AI to enhance learning. Pick a strategy and given an overview of it, including example prompts and output.

- Suggestions for designing effective assignments and classes in the AI era. What kinds of assignments work well with AI? Give an example.

- Ways that AI might affect a particular class, major, or some other aspect of Rollins.

- Developing relevant job skills in the AI era. How should students of the future be prepared to work with AI tools?

- How AI tools have already affected some industries or fields. For example, how has the introduction of high-powered AI chess engines changed how chess is played by humans?

Whatever you choose to do, make it **interesting** and **specific**.

You have freedom to make the presentation in the way you see fit, but here are some tips:

- Target 2-3 minutes of speaking time. Enough to get a point across, but not so long that your visitor gets bored.
- Four to six slides of content, not counting the title slide, is plenty. That gives you ~30 seconds per slide.
- Mix up the format of your slides. Don't just make a title with three bullet points. Incorporate graphics and consider slides that don't have words.
- Don't end with a slide that says "Questions?"; your last slide should be a summary of the important points of your talk.

## Writing

On March 22, a group called the Future of Life Institute released an open letter signed by several prominent technologists and scientists that called for pausing the development of any AI models larger than the current GPT-4.

https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/

The letter argues that, given the potential disruption of powerful AI systems, it's necessary to pause further development for at least six months and then proceed once we are confident that AI tools will be safe.

Your final assignment is to write a **critical evaluation** of this open letter. You should assess the argument that it makes and conclude, one way or the other, whether the argument is well-founded and reasonable. A few things to consider:

- Critical thinking is about assessing the quality of information and argument. That requires starting by understanding the argument that's being made. What are the key points of the article? What evidence does it bring to support those points?

- Just because an author makes a point doesn't mean you have to agree with it, but your disagreement should also be rooted in evidence. You'll need to do some background research on the open letter and the questions it raises in order to formulate your own position.

- Your evaluation should **actually take a position** on the content of the article. Note that "it depends" is not a position (depends on what?) nor is "the article makes some good points and bad points" (what are they?). You could argue, for example, that the entire concept of AI safety is unnecessary because humans have a moral responsibility to create superintelligent AIs as the only way to spread some part of ourselves throughout the universe. I'm not sure I agree with that, but at least it's a take that could be supported by an alternate set of arguments and evidence.

- Whatever you argue, you should support your own position with **evidence** in the form of citations to relevant data or papers by other authors. Note that you can't ask ChatGPT to give you citations because it will just make them up.

### Submission

You're going to submit the following:

- Your response to the open letter, approximately 800 words.

- An annotated bibliography, listing your references. For each reference, give a 1-3 sentence summary of how it relates to your response.

You can, of course, use ChatGPT or another tool to help you, but think carefully about its limitations. Don't ask it for citations and don't ask it to summarize anything from a link, because it can't do those things. The Bing AI may be more useful as a research tool. Consider using ChatGPT to interactively refine your ideas before you jump into writing. Also remember that you may want to combine generated text with hand editing.

You'll submit to two places:

- A workspace on Repl.it that I'll create for you.

- To an assignment on Canvas as part of your RFLA 300 assessment.
