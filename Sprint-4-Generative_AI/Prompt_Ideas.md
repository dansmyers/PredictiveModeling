# Prompt Ideas

These are some suggested prompts that we've developed in class. We'll keep adding to this document as we learn more.

## Suggesting Thesis Statements

> Can you please suggest thesis statements for an essay of cultural and economic analysis discussing the cultural and economic implications of Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism for the future of work and labor. Adopt the perspective of an academic expert in those areas. Be as specific as possible in suggesting creative connections between Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism.


> Okay. Let's expand on point number 3. I would like you to suggest specific new models for economic development that are enabled by Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism.

We then moved to the Bing AI and asked it to do some background research:

> Please research cryptocurrency based micropayment systems in sustainable urbanism and suggest some important points that an essay on that topic might choose to address.


## John's Prompts

> I want you to merge the two ideas of the Unconscious Mind (Philosophy/Psychology) and the Customer Persona (Marketing). Be as thoughtful, creative, and imaginative as possible. Find similarities where there are seemingly none!

> This is actually perfect, now I want you to create a rubric to assess the quality of this essay. Use criterion such as "Originality", "Grammar & Structure", "Idea Flow", "Critical Analysis", "Synthesis of Ideas". Generate this rubric in table format, and then GRADE the essay on a scale of 1-5 for each criterion, then give a final grade between A-F.
