# Prompt Ideas

These are some suggested prompts that we've developed in class. We'll keep adding to this document as we learn more.

## Suggesting thesis statements

> Can you please suggest thesis statements for an essay of cultural and economic analysis discussing the cultural and economic implications of Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism for the future of work and labor. Adopt the perspective of an academic expert in those areas. Be as specific as possible in suggesting creative connections between Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism.


> Okay. Let's expand on point number 3. I would like you to suggest specific new models for economic development that are enabled by Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism.

We then moved to the Bing AI and asked it to do some background research:

> Please research cryptocurrency based micropayment systems in sustainable urbanism and suggest some important points that an essay on that topic might choose to address.


## John's prompts

> I want you to merge the two ideas of the Unconscious Mind (Philosophy/Psychology) and the Customer Persona (Marketing). Be as thoughtful, creative, and imaginative as possible. Find similarities where there are seemingly none!

> This is actually perfect, now I want you to create a rubric to assess the quality of this essay. Use criterion such as "Originality", "Grammar & Structure", "Idea Flow", "Critical Analysis", "Synthesis of Ideas". Generate this rubric in table format, and then GRADE the essay on a scale of 1-5 for each criterion, then give a final grade between A-F.

## Another example

> I would like you to merge the ideas of Bitcoin and Sustainable Urbanism. Be as thoughtful, creative, and imaginative as possible. Find similarities where there are seemingly none!

Here's the output:

> Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism may seem like two vastly different concepts, but upon closer examination, there are several interesting ways in which they intersect and overlap.
>
> Decentralization: Both Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism prioritize decentralization. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates without a central authority, whereas sustainable urbanism focuses on creating self-sufficient, decentralized communities that are less reliant on centralized infrastructure.
>
> Energy efficiency: Bitcoin mining is notoriously energy-intensive, but there are efforts underway to make it more energy-efficient. Similarly, sustainable urbanism emphasizes the use of renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies to reduce the environmental impact of cities.
>
>Community empowerment: Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism both value community empowerment. Bitcoin allows individuals to participate in the financial system without relying on traditional banking institutions, while sustainable urbanism prioritizes community involvement in the planning and design of urban spaces.
>
>Innovation: Both Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism are driven by innovation. Bitcoin has spurred a wave of innovation in the financial technology space, while sustainable urbanism is pushing the boundaries of what is possible in terms of sustainable design and construction.
>
>Resilience: Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism both value resilience in the face of challenges. Bitcoin is designed to be resilient to attacks and censorship, while sustainable urbanism focuses on creating resilient communities that can withstand natural disasters and other disruptions.
>
>Global perspective: Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism are both global in scope. Bitcoin has created a global network of users and nodes, while sustainable urbanism seeks to address global challenges such as climate change and resource depletion.
>
>Transparency: Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism both value transparency. Bitcoin's blockchain technology allows for transparent and secure transactions, while sustainable urbanism emphasizes transparency and accountability in the planning and management of urban spaces.
>
>Collaboration: Finally, both Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism require collaboration to succeed. Bitcoin miners collaborate to maintain the integrity of the network, while sustainable urbanism requires collaboration between planners, architects, engineers, and community members to create sustainable, livable cities.
>
>In conclusion, although Bitcoin and sustainable urbanism may seem like two disparate concepts, they share many similarities and have the potential to complement each other in interesting ways. By embracing decentralization, energy efficiency, community empowerment, innovation, resilience, a global perspective, transparency, and collaboration, we can build a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
