To start, sign up for an OpenAI account (which lets you access ChatGPT) and an account for one of the image generation services, which I'll discuss in more detail below. Our goal is to use those tools to complete the following projects. Here are some general guidelines.

- You are expected to use AI tools for these assignments, in whatever way you find useful. That doesn't mean your entire piece has to be generated by AI. 

- As you're completing each assignnment, keep a **working log**, describing what you did at each step, the AI's output, and your evaluation of that output. This doesn't have to be formal, just keep an open document and write notes into it as you go.

### Ethics Explainer

This first assignment is a traditional essay-style article. You're going to write an ``explainer'' piece on ethics and AI. 

You may remember learning about three basic ethical philosophies in a previous course:

- **Virtue ethics**, associated with Aristotle and Confucius, which focuses on developing good moral character and attitudes, but not necessarily following prescriptive ethical rules.

- **Deontological ethics**, associated with Immanuel Kant, which is about articulating and following universal moral guidelines and emphasizes the inherent worth of all people.

- **Consequentialist ethics**, associatd with John Stuart Mill's principle of utilitarianism, which judges acts by their outcomes, not intentions, and seeks the greatest good for the most people.

Now consider the following prompt:

> How would a follower of each of the three main ethical philosophies advocate for the ethical development and use of artificial intelligence in society? What arguments would each philosopher make?

Your paper should have an introduction, a conclusion, and a section for each of the three philosophies. Within each section, you should give an overview of the philosophy, how it approaches the question of ethical behaviors, its strengths and weaknesses compared to the other philosophies, and a discussion of how that philosophy would evaluate artificial intelligence, including examples of the kind of arguments it would make.

Tips:

- This article is an ``explainer'', not a ``formal academic essay'' - whatever that means. Write something that your mom would actually want to read.

- You're probably going to start by pasting the prompt into ChatGPT. That's fine and it will give you a starting point, but it's not going to give you the finished product.

- **Think critically** about the AI's output. What does it do well and what does it do poorly? It's easy to be impressed by clean, grammatical sentences, but pay attention to the actual **content** of the output and how it relates to the goals of the essay.

- **Get specific**. ChatGPT does a good job giving high-level summaries of concepts, but your paper should get beyond summary and offer specific, detailed arguments. ChatGPT can help you craft those, but you have to push it.

- **Use creative prompting** and collaborative editing. Read Ethan Mollick's articles, linked below, and apply his strategies.

### Illustration

Imagine that your article is going to run in a general interest magazine. Use an AI tool to create an image that can accompany it. You can decide on the form and theme of the image, but the goal is to produce something of good quality that could plausibly appear in a real publication.

I recommend two different tools:

- **Midjourney** is the easiest image-creation tool in the current landscape. It runs as a Discord bot, so there's a bit of a learning curve in starting to use it, but it does an **extremely good job** of converting prompts into high quality images. It's best for photorealistic images, fantasy/sci-fi concept art, and some anime illustrations. You only get 25 free images before you have to subscribe, but that's enough to give you an idea of what Midjourney can do.

- **Playground AI** is a web-based service that uses Stable Diffusion, an open-source image generation AI. Stable Diffusion benefits from a larger open-source developer community that's pushing the tech forward, but it's also less tuned that Midjourney, so getting good quality images requires more effort. Right now, Playground AI lets you make up to 1000 free images per day, so it's easy to experiment with.

FYI: both sites have content filters that will reject inappropriate requests. Therefore, I think the risks associated with accidentally creating or viewing NSFW content on either service are extremely low and I feel comfortable experimenting with them in our class. If you have concerns about this point please let me know.


### Reflection

You must complete the first two deliverables before doing this one. Write a short reflective paper (about 600-800 words) describing your experiences writing and creating with generative AI tools. You're free to write what you feel is best, but consider the following questions:

- What did you think about generative AI tools before you started this unit?
- What was easy for you? What did you like about using these tools?
- What was hard? What did you not like?
- How has your awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of generative AI changed over the course of the unit?
- What ideas do you have for future explorations?


## Reading

The following articles will help you understand and work with generative AI.

Ethan Mollick has produced a lot of practical articles on using AI in the classroom. Start with the following:

- [My class required AI. Here's what I've learned](https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/my-class-required-ai-heres-what-ive)
- [The practical guide to using AI to do stuff](https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/the-practical-guide-to-using-ai-to)
- [Guide to writing with ChatGPT](https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-boost-your)

For a critical perspective focused on education, I like this article from writing professor John Warner:

- [ChatGPT can't kill anything worth preserving](https://biblioracle.substack.com/p/chatgpt-cant-kill-anything-worth)

For Playground AI / Stable Diffusion, I like Jon Stokes' guides. The series is long, so don't try to read it before you start working. Play around with the tools first, then come back and do some background reading.

- [Getting started with Stable Diffusion](https://www.jonstokes.com/p/getting-started-with-stable-diffusion). The first part is general background on machine learning, which you can skim. The second and third parts are the main discussion of SD's workflow.

General background / thinkpieces:

- [ChatGPT is a blurry JPEG of the web](https://archive.ph/VbwGB). Widely cited essay about how ChatGPT returns an "average" of the views it encountered during training.

- [I say this unironically: our society is not prepared for this much awesome](https://www.jonstokes.com/p/i-say-this-unironically-our-society). Another Jon Stokes article about what happens when everyone can make ``good'' cultural products instantly. Will education get rekt?
