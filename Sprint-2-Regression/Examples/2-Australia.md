# Weather in Australia

*Note: insert humorous meme about how everything in Australia is deadly*

## Description

This lab will allow you to practice the mechanics of implementing and interpreting an logistic regression model in Python. We'll use Pandas and the `statsmodels` library.

The data comes from Kaggle, and is a collection of weather measurements taken at stations at different locations in Australia. The goal is to predict whether it will rain on the next day given observations of the temperature, humidity, pressure, and other factors on the current day.
